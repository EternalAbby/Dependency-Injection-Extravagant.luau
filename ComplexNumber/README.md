# ComplexNumber module

## What is this module?

`ComplexNumber` is a module that adds the ability to create, and handle **complex numbers** in Luau! Inspired by `cmath` module in Python, a built-in module made for the same purpose in the Python language.

Throughout the history of Lua, there seems to be no intentions on implementing complex numbers as a built-in feature, unlike Python. That means, it is very unlikely that Luau will receive this addition for its language, and we have to manually create these systems ourselves. The amount of computations you need to remember is absolutely tiresome, and a complete nightmare for many.

Fear not! With the addition of this *open-sourced* module, you can no longer have to worry about handling them anymore! This module has already taken care for you the dreadful computations via its `ComplexNumber` objects! All you have to do is let them do their work, and watch the magic happens. For more information on how you can use this module, please check out its respective `_DOCUMENTATION` file, where every feature within this module is well-documented.

## Author's note

Thank you for using the ComplexNumber module!

This module was originally made as a coding practice for typechecking, learning how the **O**bject-**O**rientated **P**rogramming (OOP) paradigm are created within a module, and an opportunity for me to learn complex numbers.

Although, it should be noted that Luau, and similarly Lua, only allows prototype-based programming, which is a style of object-orientated programming. It's close enough to OOP.
