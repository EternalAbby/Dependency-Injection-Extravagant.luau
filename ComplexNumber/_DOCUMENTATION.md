# WORK IN PROGRESS

This file is made as a temporary solution for a Documentation for this module. Anything below will be moved into the Wiki section in the future. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that this file is complete.

## Note

Function descriptions are included with the function. However, they are not as descriptive as the ones within the `Documentation` section.

As of v1.0.0, due to current limitations with user-generated function descriptions in `Roblox Studio`. Only `Constructor`s, `Function`s, `Raw Method`s and `Method`s will include their respective function descriptions. `Metamethod`s will not have their function descriptions stated. However, they will still be listed here in the `Documentation` section.

As of v1.0.0, this module does not support `number` primitive types that are `math.huge` (inf), and `nan` (not a number). As such, these values should be avoided at all costs. When a `number` primitive type is mentioned, it should be noted that it does not include these values.

As of v1.0.0, valid `RawComplexNumber` types, and valid `ComplexNumber` types are read via `table[key]` (dynamic accessing), meaning if a false-positive type passes the assertion checks, they may trigger the `Metamethod`s of that invalid `metatable`.

## Documentation

This section includes Definitions, Constructors, Functions, Methods, and Metamethods in that order.

## Definitions

These are type definitions that are defined and used within the module.

### RawComplexNumber type

A valid `RawComplexNumber` object is defined to be a valid `RawComplexNumber` type.

A valid `RawComplexNumber` type is defined to be a `table` primitive type, which includes a `real` key, and a `complex` key. Both keys **must** have a value set to a `number` primitive type, as seen in the code block below.

*Note: Any keys besides the ones listed will be ignored in the module.*

```lua
export type RawComplexNumber = {
	["real"]: number,
	["complex"]: number
}
```

### ComplexNumber type

A valid `ComplexNumber` object is defined to be a valid `ComplexNumber` type.

A valid `ComplexNumber` type is defined to be a `table` primitive type, which includes a `real` key, and a `complex` key. Both keys **must** have a value set to a `number` primitive type, as seen in the code block below. Along with that, it must also contain a `metatable` with the `__metatable` metamethod set to `"ComplexNumber"`. This `metatable` should be set from the module itself. However, it can be locally made, which may cause problems when using this module.

*Note: Any keys besides the ones listed will be ignored in the module. Every `ComplexNumber` objects created from this module will not include any keys other than the ones listed.*

```lua
export type ComplexNumber = setmetatable<{
	["real"]: number,
	["complex"]: number
}, typeof(module)>
```

## Constructors

These are constructors that are defined within this module. These can be used by the users to create a new `ComplexNumber` object by specifying the appropriate types for the parameters.

*Note: It is possible to manually create a valid `RawComplexNumber` object, and a valid `ComplexNumber` object. They will be detected as false-positives by the runtime typechecker (using `TypeCheck V0.3.0`). There are currently no plans on reinforcing this as of v1.1.0.*

### .new(real: number, complex: number): ComplexNumber

Creates a new `ComplexNumber` object from `real`, and `complex`.

The components of this constructor is valid for both the general form (where it is formatted using `real`, and `complex`), and the rectangular form (where it is formatted using the `x-coordinate`, and the `y-coordinate`).

Returns the new `ComplexNumber` object.

If failed, throws an assertion error.

Alternatively, for constructing a new `ComplexNumber` object;

- From a valid `RawComplexNumber` type, use the `.fromRaw()` constructor instead.
- From the polar form, use the `.fromPolar()` constructor instead.

### .fromRaw(raw: RawComplexNumber): ComplexNumber

Creates a new `ComplexNumber` object from `raw`.

The components of this constructor is valid for both the general form (where it is formatted using `real`, and `complex`), and the rectangular form (where it is formatted using the `x-coordinate`, and the `y-coordinate`).

Returns the new `ComplexNumber` object.

If failed, throws an assertion error.

Alternatively, for constructing a new `ComplexNumber` object;

- From the general/rectangular form, use the `.new()` constructor instead.
- From the polar form, use the `.fromPolar()` constructor instead.

### .fromPolar(magnitude: number, argument: number): ComplexNumber

Creates a new `ComplexNumber` object from `magnitude`, and `argument` (angle value is in radians).

The components of this constructor is valid for the polar form (where it is formatted using `magnitude`, and `argument`).

Returns the new `ComplexNumber` object.

If failed, throws an assertion error.

Alternatively, for constructing a new `ComplexNumber` object;

- From the general/rectangular form, use the `.new()` constructor instead.
- From a valid `RawComplexNumber` type, use the `.fromRaw()` constructor instead.

## Functions

These are functions that are defined within this module. These can be used by the users as a pre-made quality of life feature.

### .cis(theta: number): ComplexNumber

Creates a new `ComplexNumber` object that is the result of computing the `cis()` trignometry function using `theta` (angle value is in radians).

This function is equivalent to computing the trigonometry expression: `cos(theta) + ùíä sin(theta)`.

Subsequently, it is also the result of Euler's formula: `e^(i * theta) = exp(ùíä * theta)`.

For a quick summary, this is due to the forumla's property, which states: "...establishes the relationship between the trignometric functions, and the complex exponential function" (Wikipedia). For more details, please refer to the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula) page for Euler's formula.

Returns the new `ComplexNumber` object.

## Methods

These are methods that are defined within this module. These can be used by the users to perform simple tasks on the `ComplexNumber` object which called the method (`self`).

### :clone(): ComplexNumber

Creates a new copy of the `ComplexNumber` object, whose components are from `self`.

Returns a new `ComplexNumber` object

### :magnitude(): number

Computes the magnitude (modulus/absolute value) of `self`.

Returns the result.

Alternatively, you can use the `__len()` metamethod with the `#` operator for the same result.

### :argument(): number

Computes the argument (counter-clockwise angle from the positive real axis on the complex plane) of `self`.

Returns the result.

### :conjugate(): ComplexNumber

Creates a new `ComplexNumber` object that is the complex conjugate of `self`.

Returns the new `ComplexNumber` object.

If creating a new `ComplexNumber` object is undesirable, use the `:raw_conjugate()` raw method instead.

### :polar(): (number, number)

Computes both the magnitude, and the complex argument of `self`.

Returns the `magnitude`, and the `argument`.

## Raw Methods

These are raw methods that are defined within the module. These can be used by the user to have more control over the modifications of a valid `RawComplexNumber` object, or a valid `ComplexNumber` object.

It is possible to specify as many valid `RawComplexNumber` object, and valid `ComplexNumber` object as you like. The raw methods will *iteratively* compute the operands from left to right (or in other words, from the first argument to the last argument) to `self`.

Some raw methods are similar to their `Method`, and `Metamethod` counterparts, except they will modify the left-most operand components, or `self`, instead of creating a new `ComplexNumber` object. These modifications are done so that it doesn't exhaust memory usages.

Some raw methods are similar to their `Method` counterparts, except they allow valid `RawComplexNumber` objects as their parameters.

As of v1.1.0, support for `number` primitive types are not implemented, yet. However, you can easily create a `RawComplexNumber` object as a workaround for now.

## Metamethods - Equality Comparison

All metamethods compute the magnitude of both `a`, and `b` to compare.

### .__eq(a: ComplexNumber, b: ComplexNumber): boolean

Determines whether both `a`, and `b` are *equivalent* (or the expression `a == b`).

This metamethod only fires when both `a`, and `b` have this `metatable`. For reasons why, refer to this [link here](https://create.roblox.com/docs/luau/metatables#metamethods).

Returns `true` if equivalent. Otherwise, returns `false`.

### .__lt(a: ComplexNumber, b: ComplexNumber): boolean

Determines whether `a` is *strictly less than* `b` (or the expression `a < b`).

This metamethod only fires when both `a`, and `b` have this `metatable`. For reasons why, refer to this [link here](https://create.roblox.com/docs/luau/metatables#metamethods).

Because this is also used for *strictly greater than*, this metamethod is equivalent to determining whether `b` is *strictly greater than* `a` (or the expression `b > a`). For reasons why, they are also outlined in the link above.

Returns `true` if `a` is strictly less than `b`. Otherwise, returns `false`.

### .__le(a: ComplexNumber, b: ComplexNumber): boolean

Determines whether `a` is *less than or equal to* `b` (or the expression `a <= b`).

This metamethod only fires when both `a`, and `b` have this `metatable`. For reasons why, refer to this [link here](https://create.roblox.com/docs/luau/metatables#metamethods).

Because this is also used for *greater than or equal to*, this metamethod is equivalent to determining whether `b` is *greater than or equal to* `a` (or the expression `b >= a`). For reasons why, they are also outlined in the link above.

Returns `true` if `a` is less than or equal to `b`. Otherwise, returns `false`.

## Metamethods - Other

These don't have any proper classifications, so they are placed here.

### .__len(self: ComplexNumber): number

Computes the magnitude (modulus/absolute value) of the ComplexNumber object.

Returns the result.

Alternatively, you can call the `:magnitude()` method with the same result. Internally, this metamethod directs to the method.

### .__tostring(self: ComplexNumber): string

Creates a new `string` that is formatted to display `self`, The representation is in general form, similar to that of the built-in `cmath` module in Python.

For more functionality in displaying the `string`, use the `:raw_tostring()` raw method instead.

Returns the formatted `string` to display `self`.

#### **EXAMPLE CODE**

ServerScriptService.Script

```lua
local ComplexNumber = require(path.to.module)
local num = ComplexNumber.new(2, 3)
print(num) -- using print() calls __tostring
```

Output

```lua
(2 + 3ùíä)
```
