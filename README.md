# DEPRECATED NOTICE

This repository has been DEPRECATED.

Due to how complex the workflow had become to maintain each module by myself, I cannot continue working on them in a single repository. As such, I had stopped maintaining them in this repository. However, you may find them in their own separate repository in their `README.md` or on my GitHub profile!

It has been a great journey using GitHub so far. I hope to continue enjoying this process for some time.

# Welcome to Dependency-Injection-Extravagant.luau

This is Dependency Injection Extravagant, or the acronym DIE. A repository made to include a series of modules!

This repository includes many utility modules for the [Roblox Studio](https://create.roblox.com/docs/studio/setup) game engine. However, most modules don't have to be within the game engine to work, so you can use any of the modules here in your other projects that also uses Luau!

This repository is made with the intent of;
> "Create it yourself or DIE"

Along with being very simple to use. **Feel free to use any modules from here within your project!**

# Instructions

There are 2 main methods to download modules from this repository: individual and group. You can choose whichever you find more convenient.

## Individual download

To download a module from this repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Head over to the `Releases` page of this repository.
2. Find the module that you would like to download. They are labeled with the format of `<module_name>-<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>.<file_extension>`.
	- For the Roblox Studio game engine, you should download the `.rbxm` file.
	- For general use, you should download the `.luau` file.
3. Depending on your choice, this step deviates:
	- For the `.rbxm` file, drag and drop or copy and paste it into the `Explorer` and it will appear in your game place.
	- For the `.luau` file, you can simply move it into your project.
4. That is all. Enjoy!

## Group download

This option is limited to only the `.rbxm` file as this repository doesn't use any installation managers.

Similar to the steps in `Individual download`, except you download that one named `Dependency-Injection-Extravagant-<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>.rbxm`.

Downloading this file will include a folder with every modules in it, so you don't have to download them individually.
