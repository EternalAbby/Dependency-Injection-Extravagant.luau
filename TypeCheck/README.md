# TypeCheck module

## What is this module?

`TypeCheck` is a module made for handling runtime **type checking** in Luau! Inspired by another open-sourced Luau module, called `t`, which also handles runtime type checking.

Typechecking can be a pain to understand, and handle within your scripts, because there may be edge cases that you didn't know about! With this module, it has already handled for you what is needed to be checked, all you have to do is to properly use typecasting on those variables, and everything is solved.

*Note: As of v0.1.0, this module has limited functionalities for typechecking some primitive types, and types from `ComplexNumber` module. It is recommended that this module shouldn't be used in production code, as it is still in its unstable state, and may have impactful changes in the future.*

## Author's note

Thank you for using the TypeCheck module!

This was originally made as a coding practice for typechecking.

Due to the dependency of the `ComplexNumber` module, this module was made public during its development.
