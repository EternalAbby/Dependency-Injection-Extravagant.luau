# TypeCheck module

## Author's note

Thank you for using the TypeCheck module!

This was originally made as a coding practice for typechecking.

Due to the dependency of the `ComplexNumber` module, this module was made public during its development. However, it is still in an unstable state, so be warned when using this module.
